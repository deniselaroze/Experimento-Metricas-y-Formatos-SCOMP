## This folder contains replication material for the research project "Facilitadores y distractores en la selección de pensiones".

It includes:
* The research agreement with the Superintendencia de Pensiones
* IRB approval
* Treatments used in the experiment
* R script to create treatments
* Descriptive statistics used for case selection
* Pre-registration report from OSF


## This repository also contains the data analysis duplication material for the manuscripit titled "Choice Architecture Improves Pension Provider Selection"

This includes:
- R-script with the code used for data management, from the Raw Data files to the data structure used in the Data Analysis R-script. The Raw data includes personal information used to clean duplicates and check issues with participation protocol. Because of this personal information, the untouched Raw data file is not included at the moment.  
- R-Script with the code for the data analysis
- Cleaned Rdata file used in the Data Analysis script.  

### Abstract:
Consumers in Chile of private and semi-private pension systems are not selecting the pension providers that give them the largest Net Present Value FNE (2008).  Regulators present retirees with a comparison report of pension plan offerings ranked by amount offered and the risk classification of the provider.  A field experiment implemented in Chile explores alternative presentations of provider performance. We treat subjects by modifying the status quo information ``package'' (that exactly replicate what is currently provided by the regulator).  Two design choices clearly enhanced consumer welfare in this experiment:  Reducing the amount of information appears to have improved choice -- specifically eliminating the risk profiles of providers lead to better decisions by our subjects.  Second, adopting a loss frame also resulted in subjects selecting providers that generated higher returns.  These gains to choice architecture were considerably higher for those with lower levels of financial literacy. This study is conducted in association with the Superintendencia de Pensiones (SP) and the Comisión para el Mercado Financiero (CMF), two of the  public offices that oversee the pensions market in Chile.
